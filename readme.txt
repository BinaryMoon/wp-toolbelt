Utilities to make your website betterer.

== Description ==

A collection of simple addons that provide every day functionality with speed and elegance. There's no options, and no unnecessary filler. It does exactly what it needs to do and nothing else.

Taking inspiration from Jetpack I want to rebuild the features I use the most and make them as simple and fast as possible.

= Features =

= Fast =

I want it to be fast. I want to be able to enable any of the features and not have my Google Pagespeed score drop. To be fast it:

* Doesn't use jQuery or any other javascript framework. All javascript is vanilla js, and minified.
* Minifies all assets (JS and CSS)
* Loads all assets inline. They are already small, and loading them directly on the page means there are no server requests.
* Only loads things when they are needed. JS and CSS are only loaded for activated modules.
* No options. There's only one database option, and that's an array that stores what modules are active.
* Uses the minimum code possible. Minimum Javascript and PHP. Less code means more speed, and fewer bugs.
* All options are disabled by default. You enable just the ones you need.

= Private =

To ensure the plugin is as privacy focused as possible it:

* Does not phone out. No data is shared with third parties.
* Does not use standard social sharing javascripts (loaded from social networks servers).
* Does not track your usage of the plugin.
* Does not add generator comments, or secret comments to your site html.

= More... =

* The code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/BinaryMoon/wp-toolbelt)
* Documentation with code examples can be found on [the wiki](https://github.com/BinaryMoon/wp-toolbelt/wiki)
* You can reach out to me with questions or problems on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/binarymoon)

== FAQ ==

= Why one plugin and not separate plugins? =

I am making this because it's something I want to use. I like the simplicity of installing Jetpack and letting it do it's thing. But it's not designed for speed or elegance, so I am trying to address that with my own plugin.

I am making the theme as developer friendly as I can. Things can be tweaked using WordPress filters, and I will add more of these as I go.

= Do you have any documentation? =

The [docs are on Github](https://github.com/BinaryMoon/wp-toolbelt/wiki). They are a constant work in progress.

= Can I contribute/ report a problem? =

Yes please! You can [submit issues](https://github.com/BinaryMoon/wp-toolbelt/issues) on Github or add questions to the support forum. I'd be happy to accept pull requests as well.

= What features will you add next? =

I don't know. I'm open to suggestions (ping me on Twitter), but I'll probably just add things as I need them.
