Fast, privacy focused, utilities to improve your website. Includes a Markdown block, spam protection, related posts, cookie banner, and more.

== Description ==

A collection of simple addons that provide every day functionality with privacy and speed. There's very few options, and no unnecessary filler. It does exactly what it needs to do and nothing else.

Toolbelt takes a privacy first approach to adding features. Everything happens on your server. No data is sent to third party servers without your explicit consent. No data is loaded from third parties (for example social sharing scripts).

Taking inspiration from Jetpack I want to rebuild the features I use the most and make them as simple and fast as possible.

Toolbelt has been featured on The WordPress Tavern in [an interview with me](https://wptavern.com/toolbelt-a-new-jetpack-inspired-plugin-with-a-focus-on-speed-and-privacy). You can read more about the creation of the plugin and my desire for a more private internet.

= Gutenberg Blocks =

Some of the Toolbelt modules include blocks to make working with the generated content easier. The available blocks are:

* **Contact Form** - The simplest way to have people get in touch. Works with the spam module.
* **Post Categories** - A category content list for magazine and newspaper themes.
* **Simple Slider** - A fast, CSS powered slider. No JavaScript and easy to edit.
* **Projects Grid** - to list a collection of projects. These can be filtered by project category.
* **Testimonials Grid** - to list a group of testimonials. Great for showing off! :)
* **Markdown** - for those who like a simpler writing experience.
* **Sitemap** - Easily list all posts, pages, Categories and Projects.
* **Star Rating** - Rate things with a simple visual interface.
* **Breadcrumbs** - for full site editing.
* **Related posts** - for full site editing.

= Toolbelt is Private =

Every week there's a new story about Facebook (or Google, or Amazon, or whoever) tracking people inappropriately, or selling user details. Or some security breach that leaks users passwords or credit card info. Privacy is a big topic and frankly, it's scary how much big corporations like Google, Facebook, and Twitter know.

To ensure Toolbelt is as privacy focused as possible it:

* Does not phone out. **No data is shared with third parties**.
* Does not use standard social sharing javascripts (loaded from social networks servers).
* Does not track your usage of the plugin.
* Does not add generator comments, or secret promotional comments to your site html.

= Toolbelt is Fast =

Slow websites make me sad. I don't want to add anything to Toolbelt that will impact site load speed. My Google Pagespeed score should not move from 100.

Why? Faster sites are shown to increase conversions and time on site. Google loves fast sites and improves their search rankings. In addition fast sites are great for people with slower internet access, or on mobile data, and use less resources to generate the page. So many benefits!

To be fast Toolbelt:

* Doesn't use jQuery or any other javascript framework. All javascript is vanilla js, and minified.
* Minifies all assets (JS and CSS).
* Loads all assets inline. They are already small, and loading them directly on the page means there are no server requests.
* Only loads things when they are needed. JS and CSS are only loaded for activated modules.
* Very few options. There's one main database option, an array that stores what modules are active. And another that stores settings for some modules.
* Uses the minimum code possible. Minimum Javascript and PHP. Less code means more speed, and fewer bugs.
* All options are disabled by default. You enable only the ones you need.

= Built for developers =

Toolbelt is built with developers in mind. It has a collection of hooks and filters to enable you to make the modules work the way you want. If youâ€™re intersted to jump in the project, there are opportunities for developers at all levels to help out.

== FAQ ==

= Why does WordFence (and other WAF's) flag this file as a vulnerability?

The file `/wp-toolbelt/modules/spam-blocker/blocklist.txt` is used by the spam blocker to check comments for spam phrases. It is regularly updated.

As such it contains lots of spammy words, and constantly changes. Both things that could trigger a vulnerability warning.

The best thing to do is mark this file (and only this file) as 'Ignore Always'. This will stop you from getting warnings for this one file whilst monitoring the rest of the plugin for suspicious changes.

= Why one plugin and not separate plugins? =

I am making this because it's something I want to use. I like the simplicity of installing Jetpack and letting it do it's thing. But Jetpack is not designed for speed or elegance, so I am trying to address that with my own plugin.

I am making the plugin as developer friendly as I can. Things can be tweaked using WordPress filters, and I will add more of these as I go.

= Do you have any documentation? =

The [docs are on Github](https://github.com/BinaryMoon/wp-toolbelt/wiki). They are a constant work in progress.

= Can I contribute/ report a problem? =

Yes please! You can [submit issues](https://github.com/BinaryMoon/wp-toolbelt/issues) on Github or add questions to the support forum. I'd be happy to accept pull requests as well.

= What features will you add next? =

I don't know. I'm open to suggestions (ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/binarymoon)), but mostly I'll add things as I need them.

== Installation ==

1. Install and Activate the plugin through the plugins page.
